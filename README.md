# Gold Badge Challenges

Completed Gold Badge Challenges (1-3) for Eleven Fifty Academy's part-time Software Development class #71A. Joe Macko is the sole author.

## Description

Komodo Cafe (Challenge 1) - Console app for a restaurant. Managers can create, read, and delete meals on a menu. Properties of the meals include price, meal numbers, meal names, descriptions, and ingredients. 

Komodo Claims (Challenge 2) - Console app for a claims department that holds a queue of claims. Agents can view all claims, enter new claims, take care of existing claims, and update exiting claims. Properties of the claims include claim identification numbers, claim types (car, home, or theft), descriptions, claim amounts, incident dates, claim dates, and whether a claim is valid or not.

Komodo Insurance (Challenge 3) - Console app for an insurance company that utilizes a dictionary collection. The dictionary corresponds to a badge identification number (key) and a list of doors each badge has access to (value). Employees can create new badges, view existing badges collectively or individually, and update (add or delete) doors on an existing badge. 

## Project Status

Nearly complete. A few unit tests may not pass, or may not be testing the correct methods. The user interface for each challenge has all the required functionality, but may not be incredibly user friendly. The owner will continue to refine the project for practice.
